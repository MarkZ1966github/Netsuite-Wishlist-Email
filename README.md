# Netsuite-Wishlist-Email

Here is a Netsuite Javascript file for you. 

For those that are still on site builder (pos) and you have the wishlist feature, this will let people load out of stock items into the wishlist (how it's suppose to work) and when the item has more than ZERO - this js file can be scheduled to send an email to the customer. This fully works as is. 

The thing that really is disappointing about this, as it took a bit of hours to get right - the company person that wanted it written decided they really didn't want an email after all!!! grrrrr...
